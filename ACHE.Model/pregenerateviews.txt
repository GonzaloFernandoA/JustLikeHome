Step 1
Go to your Model properties and select “Copy to Output Directory” for the Metadata Artifact Processing option.

Step 2

Next you need to setup the Pre-build:
"%windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\EdmGen.exe" /mode:ViewGeneration "/inssdl:$(TargetDir)KonSalModel.ssdl" "/incsdl:$(TargetDir)KonSalModel.csdl" "/inmsl:$(TargetDir)KonSalModel.msl" "/outviews:$(ProjectDir)KonSalModel.Views.cs" /nologo /language:CSharp

Step 3
The .ssdl, .csdl & .msl files will be generated on every build and output to the TargetDir, however it’s a good idea to include them in your Project.

In the Post-build event you can add a simple XCOPY like below to copy the files to the root of your project:

XCOPY "$(TargetDir)MyModel.csdl" "$(ProjectDir)" /R /Y 
XCOPY "$(TargetDir)MyModel.ssdl" "$(ProjectDir)" /R /Y 
XCOPY "$(TargetDir)MyModel.msl" "$(ProjectDir)" /R /Y

 

Step 4
Build the project which contains your Entity Model.

If it built successfully you should find the following files in the root of your Project folder

MyModel.Views.cs
MyModel.csdl
MyModel.ssdl
MyModel.msl
Go ahead and include all these files in your project, Show All Files > Right Click > Include In Project

Step 5
Now for MyModel.csl, MyModel.ssdl, MyModel.msl you want to include these as an embedded resource

For each of the above files select the “Embedded Resource” Build Action in the Properties window.
